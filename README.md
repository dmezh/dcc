# ECE-466 - Compilers

![Build Action](https://github.com/dmezh/ece466-compilers/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

This is a graduate-level course centered on the construction of a simple C compiler.

This compiler performs most of the source.c -> a.out process, but is aided by an external preprocessor and an external assembler and linker.

## Lexer
The [lexer](1-lexer/) is built with Flex and reads and tokenizes C-language input, which should be preprocessed (for example, with gcc -E). All of C99 should be covered.Note that the token definitions are based on the parser.tab.h generated by Bison, so the parser must be generated before the lexer is built. The standalone lexer will print readable tokenized output.

To build/use standalone:
```bash
cd 1-lexer
make
./lex OR gcc -E code.c | ./lex
```

You can also use `make test` to compare against a provided (from class) standard lexing test suite.

## Parser
The [parser](2-parser/) is built with Bison parses tokenized input. Currently, expressions are supported (but not declarations, etc). The output is an abstract syntax tree, which is dumped to stdout when using the standaline parser. The parser directly calls the lexer, so feed it preprocessed C files or individual lines just like for the lexer.

To build/use standalone:
```bash
cd 2-parser
make
./parse OR gcc -E code.c | ./parse
```
