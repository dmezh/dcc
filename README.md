# ECE-466 - Compilers

This is a graduate-level course centered on the construction of a simple C compiler.

This compiler performs most of the source.c -> a.out process, but is aided by an external preprocessor and an external assembler and linker.

# Lexer
The [lexer](1-lexer/) is made using Flex.
